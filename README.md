# DcsBiosSharp
.NET Standard SDK for DCS-BIOS . Currently under WIP (so does this readme). The intention is to provide a modern SDK to interact with DCS-BIOS plugin for DCS World. This project has neither direct relationship with the original creator of DCS-BIOS nor the DCS-BIOS original repo itself.

# Example
Please check the inner SimpleClient for rough idea on how this would works. More examples will be provided later on as the API get more finalized.
